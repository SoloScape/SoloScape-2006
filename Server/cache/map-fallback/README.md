# Location map fallbacks

These files contain decoded location streams, loaded by both the client and
server when the bundled encrypted map cannot be decoded. Terrain and object
definitions still come from the bundled revision 443 cache.

## Taverley dungeon entrance

`l45_53.dat` restores the missing surface ladder (`1759`, type 10, rotation 0)
at `2884,3397,0`. The hole decoration and all other placements are retained.
The native underground map already contains the exit ladder (`1755`) at
`2884,9797,0`; the existing server handlers provide travel in both directions.
Restart the server and client to reload the shared map fallback.

`Client/tests/TaverleyDungeonChecks.java` verifies both cached ladder placements,
their revision-443 models and click options, and a round trip through the server
object interaction handler. Compile it with both client/server classes and
`Server/lib/*`, then run from `Server`.

## Recovered Varrock maps

The previous `l49_53.dat`, `l49_54.dat`, `l50_54.dat`, and `l51_54.dat` streams
were incomplete. West Varrock had only 44 wall/corner placements, and the west
bank booth tiles contained object 11402 (an interface button) instead of 2213.

The replacements use archive 5, file 0 of the corresponding named groups in
[OpenRS2 cache 2079](https://archive.openrs2.org/caches/runescape/2079), revision
457. These are compatible historical replacements, not decrypted originals
from revision 443. They restore the bank, castle, and neighbouring buildings
while retaining revision 443 terrain, definitions, and models.

To reproduce, decode each named location group using that cache's `keys.json`.
Keep only object groups with a definition in the bundled archive 2/group 6 and
whose referenced models exist in bundled archive 7. Re-encode the object ID
deltas relative to the last retained ID; retain position deltas and type/rotation
bytes within each retained group. Finish each group and the stream with zero.
Do not filter individual placements without recalculating position deltas.

| Map | Source placements | Removed unsupported placements | Restored wall/corner placements |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 49_53 | 4101 | 0 | 1201 |
| 49_54 | 2587 | 6 | 363 |
| 50_54 | 5050 | 5 | 1893 |
| 51_54 | 2827 | 53 | 753 |

`Client/tests/VarrockMapChecks.java` checks the shared loading path, the west
bank's wall and booth coordinates, and all referenced definitions and models.
Run from `Server` after compiling it with both client and server classes plus
`Server/lib/*` on the classpath. Restart the server and reload the client to
replace maps already held in memory.

## Whole-world audit (2026-10-01)

The audit traversed all 792 terrain/location squares in the bundled reference
table, including 704 native revision-443 maps and 88 fallback maps. The latest
OpenRS2 key list for cache 2700 still contains the same 545 keys as the bundled
list, so no additional encrypted originals could be recovered with new keys.
All native location maps passed the definition/model/placement-type checks.

Six more incomplete building maps were recovered from cache 2079, using the
same compatibility filtering described above. These replacements also exclude
placements whose type cannot be rendered by their revision-443 definition.
They retain the bundled terrain; they are historical approximations where the
original encrypted revision-443 location stream remains unavailable.

| Map | Walls/corners before | Walls/corners after |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 42_54 | 215 | 1131 |
| 45_54 | 668 | 761 |
| 48_54 | 644 | 690 |
| 51_52 | 17 | 507 |
| 53_54 | 323 | 329 |
| 54_54 | 22 | 655 |

Six other maps keep all their original object IDs, coordinates, rotations, and
models, with unambiguous placement-type corrections to match the existing
revision-443 model shapes:

| Map | Object | Correction | Placements |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| 38_69 | 15506 (rug) | 10 to 22 | 13 |
| 42_58 | 14170 (pile of eggs) | 22 to 10 | 1 |
| 44_54 | 15520 (old bookshelf) | 22 to 10 | 3 |
| 46_54 | 15523 (bookcase) | 22 to 10 | 1 |
| 48_51 | 15506 (rug) | 10 to 22 | 318 |
| 48_61 | 733 (web) | 0 to 10 | 2 |

The repair manifest in `world-map-repairs.tsv` records before/after counts,
excluded unsupported placements, corrections, and SHA-256 hashes for these
twelve repairs. `world-map-audit.tsv` contains one validation row per square.
The two fallback regions 29_79 and 30_79 have no decoded comparison source in
the inspected historical caches; they pass the local asset/shape checks and
were retained. An automated cache audit cannot prove that every historical
placement is present or replace in-game visual inspection.

Run the reproducible whole-world check from the repository root in PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force Client/build/map-checks | Out-Null
javac -cp 'Client/build/classes;Server/build/classes;Server/lib/*' -d Client/build/map-checks Client/tests/WorldMapChecks.java Client/tests/VarrockMapChecks.java
Push-Location Server
java -Xmx1024m -cp '../Client/build/map-checks;../Client/build/classes;build/classes;lib/*' WorldMapChecks cache/map-fallback/world-map-audit.tsv
java -cp '../Client/build/map-checks;../Client/build/classes;build/classes;lib/*' VarrockMapChecks
Pop-Location
```

The whole-world check validates complete terrain and location streams, every
placement's model shape, definition/model references including object morphs,
actual model decoding and triangle indices, and minimum building counts for
the recovered squares. The separate Varrock check verifies its repaired bank.
